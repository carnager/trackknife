# ADR-0111: Limited-filesystem publication tolerance

- Status: accepted

- Extends: ADR-0063 bounded publication apply, ADR-0105 conversion core,
  ADR-0083 trust over confirmation

## Context

Publishing to network and removable filesystems hit three walls, found by
probing a real NFSv4.2 NAS mount (and previously sshfs): `renameat2`
`RENAME_NOREPLACE` is rejected with EINVAL; extended-attribute support is
absent on some filesystems while NFS additionally exposes kernel-owned
names like `system.nfs4_acl` that refuse removal; and ownership changes
are refused under server-side identity mapping. A fourth, subtler wall:
publishing by hard link + unlink trips NFS silly-rename when the
publisher holds the file open, leaving a transient extra link that the
strict single-link topology verification rightly refuses.

## Decisions

- `core::publish_no_replace_at` is the shared no-replace publish:
  `renameat2(RENAME_NOREPLACE)` first; on flag rejection a plain rename
  immediately follows — safe because the VFS resolves the target before
  the filesystem sees the flag, so an occupied target already reported
  EEXIST; on ENOSYS (no renameat2 at all) an explicit existence check
  precedes the rename. A hard-link rung was deliberately rejected: it is
  fully atomic but breaks under NFS silly-rename with open publishers.
  The converter and the publication executor both use the ladder.
- Extended-attribute preservation manages the `user.` namespace only;
  `system.`/`security.`/`trusted.` names are kernel- or filesystem-owned
  representations (NFS ACLs, SELinux labels) the destination manages
  itself. A filesystem reporting ENOTSUP lists as empty-and-unsupported:
  publication proceeds, verification compares only where both sides
  support xattrs, and when the source actually carried user attributes a
  note reports the loss instead of an error. Zero-xattr sources publish
  with no note at all — the original sshfs failure was exactly this
  over-strict case.
- Ownership preservation (`fchown`) tolerates EPERM/ENOTSUP with a note;
  mode preservation tolerates ENOTSUP. Verification and recovery enforce
  only what was achievable; recovery no longer compares ownership at all,
  as host identity mapping is not content.
- Notes travel on `FilePublicationCommitResult::notes` and render
  problems-only after Apply: an all-success run with notes shows
  "Updated with notes" instead of silently closing. Tag commits
  (source and prepared copy share one filesystem) degrade silently —
  a filesystem without xattrs has none to lose on either side.

## Verification

Probed and proven on the real NAS (`tauron:/mnt/MEDIA/MEDIA`, NFS 4.2):
xattrs supported, `renameat2` flags rejected, `link` works, `fchown`
refused even to the owning uid. The full audio-convert suite passes with
its temporaries on the mount, and a real local→NAS move publication
committed end to end — bytes verified, `user.` xattr preserved,
ownership note surfaced, source removed only after verification.
